Andrew Fairless, May 2011
This program colors cells within a pre-selected area
Specifically, the program colors cells with values < 0.05 yellow; between 0.05 and 0.10 orange; and between 0.10 and 0.15 light green
The cells' values are intended to be p-values, with the different colors corresponding to levels of significance
